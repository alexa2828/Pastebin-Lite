# Pastebin-Lite

A simple Pastebin-like web application that allows users to create text pastes and share them via a unique URL.  
Pastes can optionally expire based on **time (TTL)** or **view count**.

Pastebin-Lite is a minimalist web application that allows users to create text pastes and share them via unique, shareable URLs. 
The application supports optional constraints, including time-based expiry (TTL) and view-count limits, ensuring pastes become unavailable once a constraint is met.
